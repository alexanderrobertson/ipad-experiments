* Need installed:

  git https://git-scm.com/download/mac
  heroku https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

  Heroku account:
    login
    pass
  

* Set up Heroku

  - login if needed:
      heroku login

  - create a new app with name of NAME. This NAME will make the URL for the app, which will be NAME.herokuapp.com:
      heroku create NAME

  - it should set your remote git location to this, but if not then use:
      heroku git:remote -a NAME


* Set up app folder

  - in a folder, make two files. These are used to get heroku to work as a PHP app, as there is no way to do a plain
    html/js app:
      composer.json
      index.php

  - composer.json should be one line:
      {}

  - index.php should be one line:
      <?php include_once("main.html"); ?>

  - in this folder, create a new repository:
      git init


* Update git

  - write whatever code you want or make changes etc

  - update the repository with the files in the folder:
      git add .

  - commit the changes to the repository, with a description:
      git commit -m "description here"

* Push git to heroku

  - To upload the app to heroku and get it running:
      git push heroku master

* Check app is on heroku

  - Go to http://NAME.herokuapp.com/appfilename.html in a web browser

    (appfilename.html will depend on what you named your app's main page)

* Multiple apps

  - each has its own folder
  - each folder contains a git repo
  - each app also has its own app/domain on heroku

  - be careful when working with more than one app, that you don't push the wrong git repo to your currently selected heroku app!
  - check current git remote point on heroku with:
      git remote -v
  - if it is not set to the right one, then change it with:
      heroku git:remote -a NAME
