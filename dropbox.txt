Dropbox account:

Use https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps to add Dropbox apps (these are folders where stuff can be saved)

Dropbox is used to save the data from experiments.

Each experiment has its own folder on the Dropbox account, which Dropbox calls an app.

Access is by app key and access token.

App key = a key for the Dropbox app, different for each experiment

Access token = a token for the Dropbox account to access the app.

You need to generate an access token for the app key, on the developer's page.

A more secure way to do this would be to use Dropbox's OAUTH2 API (where you would login before running the experiment rather than using these keys/tokens) but I just couldn't get it to work!
