# Judgement and reaction time experiments

These experiments involved making judgements about which two photos/sounds were the most similar.

They were run on iPads, letting the experimenter input some details at the beginning. Data was pushed to a Dropbox account at the end.

The apps themselves were hosted on Heroku.

The code was adapted from https://github.com/langcog/tablet
